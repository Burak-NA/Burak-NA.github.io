This program calculates the minimum value of a house with an void function. 


Link to the code is given at the bottom of this page.


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

void computeHomeValue()
{
    int neighborhood_pop; /*Population of the neighborhood to be input by user */
    int size;             /*Size of the house to be input by user*/
    int HomeValue;     /*Output of the program, gives the minimum value of the house*/

    printf("How many people lives in the neighborhood?");
    scanf("%d", &neighborhood_pop); /*Takes the neighborhood population value from user*/

    printf("What is the size of the house?");
    scanf("%d", &size);             /*Takes the house size value from user*/

    HomeValue= ((pow(neighborhood_pop, 3))+(pow(size, 2)))*10000; /*Calculates the minimum value of the house*/

    printf("The minimum value of the house is %.2f TL", HomeValue); /*Outputs the minimum value of the house*/
}

int main()
{

    computeHomeValue(); /* Call function to compute and print home value */


    return 0;
}
